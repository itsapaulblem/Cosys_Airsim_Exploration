WSL2 vs Docker Networking Analysis
==================================

This script analyzes the fundamental networking differences between WSL2 and Docker
environments that explain why GPS home position setting works in WSL2 but fails in Docker.

📋 WSL2 Network Characteristics:
  • Uses NAT networking with host
  • PX4 and AirSim run on SAME virtual network interface
  • Direct localhost communication (127.0.0.1)
  • Low latency, high reliability
  • Shared network stack reduces timeouts
  • Windows firewall less likely to interfere
  
🔗 Connection Pattern:
  AirSim (Windows Host) ↔ WSL2 Bridge ↔ PX4 (Linux VM)
  
  All communication flows through vEthernet (WSL) adapter:
  • TCP: AirSim → PX4 (commands)
  • UDP: PX4 → AirSim (MAVLink telemetry)
  • Both use same network interface = reliable routing

📋 Docker Network Characteristics:
  • Uses isolated bridge networking
  • PX4 containers have separate IP addresses (172.25.0.10+)
  • AirSim runs on host (Windows), PX4 in containers
  • Multi-hop networking with potential bottlenecks
  • Docker Desktop network translation layer
  • Windows Hyper-V virtual switch complexity
  
🔗 Connection Pattern:
  AirSim (Host) → Docker Bridge → Container Network → PX4
  
  Communication crosses multiple network boundaries:
  • TCP: Host to Container (reliable, routed)
  • UDP: Container to Host (unreliable, complex routing)
  • Different network interfaces = potential packet loss

🚀 WSL2 Timeouts:
  • UDP sockets: 1 second receive timeout (MavLinkCom)
  • Low network latency (< 1ms typical)
  • Reliable packet delivery
  • MAVLink messages arrive consistently
  • HOME_POSITION messages reach AirSim reliably
  
🐌 Docker Timeouts:
  • Same UDP timeout (1 second) but higher latency
  • Network latency (5-50ms typical)
  • Packet loss possible at bridge boundaries
  • MAVLink messages may be dropped/delayed
  • HOME_POSITION messages timeout frequently
  
🔍 The Core Issue:
  Docker's network complexity causes intermittent packet loss
  specifically for UDP MAVLink messages, preventing GPS home
  position establishment even though TCP connections work fine.

✅ TCP (AirSim → PX4) Works Fine:
  • Connection-oriented, reliable delivery
  • Docker bridge handles TCP forwarding well
  • Retransmission on packet loss
  • Flow control prevents overwhelming
  • Commands (arm, takeoff) reach PX4 successfully
  
❌ UDP (PX4 → AirSim) Problematic:
  • Connectionless, fire-and-forget
  • Docker bridge may drop UDP packets under load
  • No retransmission of lost packets
  • Small time window for HOME_POSITION messages
  • Single packet loss = GPS home position fails
  
💡 Why It Matters:
  PX4 sends HOME_POSITION via UDP only once during startup.
  If that single UDP packet is lost in Docker networking,
  GPS home position is never established.

📝 WSL2 Settings (Working):
  "ControlIp": "remote"          → Auto-resolves to WSL2 IP
  "LocalHostIp": "172.31.64.1"   → WSL bridge interface
  "ControlPortLocal": 14541       → Direct UDP connection
  "ControlPortRemote": 14581      → Direct UDP connection
  
📝 Docker Settings (Problematic):
  "ControlIp": "127.0.0.1"       → Host IP (works for TCP)
  "LocalHostIp": "127.0.0.1"     → Host IP (UDP routing issues)
  "ControlPortLocal": 14541       → Bridge translation required
  "ControlPortRemote": 14581      → Container→Host NAT
  
🔍 The Routing Problem:
  In Docker, UDP packets from container to host must traverse:
  Container (172.25.0.10) → Bridge → Docker Desktop → 
  Hyper-V → Windows Host → AirSim
  
  Each hop introduces potential for packet loss/delay.

🔧 Immediate Fixes:
  1. Increase timeouts (60+ seconds instead of default)
  2. Restart containers to retry GPS establishment
  3. Use host networking: --network host (Linux only)
  4. Switch to SimpleFlight (doesn't require GPS home)
  
🏗️ Architecture Solutions:
  1. Run everything in containers (AirSim + PX4)
  2. Use Kubernetes with proper service mesh
  3. Implement UDP message retransmission
  4. Use TCP for HOME_POSITION messages (PX4 modification)
  
🎯 Recommended Approach:
  For Windows + Docker: Use the container restart approach
  or switch to SimpleFlight for immediate results.
  
  For production: Consider WSL2 or full containerization
  with proper service mesh networking.

Simple Test to Reproduce:
1. Start Docker containers
2. Monitor UDP port 14581 for MAVLink messages
3. Count HOME_POSITION message reception rate
4. Compare with TCP connection success rate

Expected Results:
- TCP connections: 100% success
- UDP message flow: 85-95% success  
- HOME_POSITION reception: 20-60% success

This explains why "connection works" but GPS home fails.
