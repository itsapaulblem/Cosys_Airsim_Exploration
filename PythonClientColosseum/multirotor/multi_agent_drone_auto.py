Enhanced Multi-Agent Drone Script with Auto Vehicle Discovery
===========================================================

This script automatically discovers available vehicles in the AirSim simulation
and makes them take off. Since listVehicles() is not available in Colosseum,
it uses a discovery method to detect active vehicles.

Features:
- Automatic vehicle discovery
- Batch takeoff for all discovered vehicles
- Error handling for individual vehicles
- Configurable vehicle detection
